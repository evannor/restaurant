      <h3>DRAPER VALLEY FARMS</h3>
      <p>Draper Valley Farms has been a Northwest tradition since 1935, and today remains singularly focused on providing carefully raised, fresh, local chicken to the Northwest. Today, they follow a simple guiding principle: "the way nature intended." All of their chickens are raised in a reduced stress environment, fed an all-vegetarian diet with no animal fats or animal proteins, and never, ever receive any antibiotics.</p>
